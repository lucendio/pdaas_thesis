## Personal Data as a Product



The *Big Data* paradigm itself, as mentioned before, merely provides a structured and technically-based 
method to uncover non-obvious or non-visible information from self-made data silos in order to 
assist in making (correct) (business) decisions. Though, when asking data collectors about their 
actual motivation, most likely the answer would be something along the lines of typical PR-phrasing 
like *"we want to have a better understanding of our customers"*. In the long run, this means to 
increase revenue, but in the short term, to do what exactly? Maybe to predict what might be the next 
thing people are supposed to buy, or what things they would probably like to consume but do 
not yet know of?

In order to try comprehending such perspective, let's take a look at some examples.

(A) An advertising service utilizes tracking data for targeted advertising. The more information the 
service has on an individual, the more accurate decisions it is able to make about what ads are 
the ones that the individual most likely will click on and disclose with a successful purchase. 
As a result the placed advertisement becomes more valuable to the advertiser, because of its high 
precision. This again causes the service to increase the charges for serving and presenting the ad, 
because the overall quality of its service - the product - has improved.

(B) Content recommendation engines of large streaming providers, regardless of the content, serve 
as another example. This feature is also underpinned by extensive data aggregation of customer
information (user profiling), such as consumption histories (e.g. watch list), favoured content, 
friend's consumption, or any kind of trackable platform interaction. This means that the more information 
the service has on the user, the more precise are the assumptions about current mood, taste and 
interests, which leads to more suitable recommendations. At the end the user feels well taken care 
of and therefore values the service.

(C) Another example is *Google Traffic* [@web_2007_introducing-google-traffic] 
[@web_2016_wikipedia_google-traffic], a service that is integrated as a feature in *Google Maps*, 
a web-based mapping service from Google. *Google Traffic* visualises real-time traffic conditions, 
while using *Maps* as a navigation assistant in order to provide the user with a selection
of possible paths. These paths are enriched with a duration that takes the traffic conditions 
into account. 
The data required to offer such information is supplied by mobile devices, constantly sending its 
current position including a timestamp to Google's infrastructure. This however, is only possible, 
because Google's services are widely used in addition to the significant market share of mobile 
devices [@graphic_2016_global-mobile-os-market-share] that are driven by Android - a mobile 
operating system developed by Google that deeply integrates with its services.
The same assumptions can be made as stated in the previous examples. The more geo-location data is obtained, the more precise the information about traffic conditions are. Since 
this scenario demands real-time information, it adds the *time* component as an additional level of 
complexity to the problem.

The impact on the society of the first group of examples might be questionable and it is doubtful if proper applications even exist.  However, an adjustment of perspective reveals additional 
categories of scenarios, for example:

(D) Planning and managing human resources for special occasions with big crowds, such as huge events 
or emergency situations where attendees might become endangered and require help 
[@estimating-the-locations-of-emergency-events-from-twitter-streams_2014]

(E) Predicting infrastructure workloads (e.g. power grid) 
[@paper_2015_improving-power-grid-monitoring-data-quality-an-efficient-machine-learning-framework-for-missing-data-prediction]

(F) Making more accurate diagnostics to improve a patient's therapy 
[@the-practice-of-predictive-analytics-in-healthcare_2013]
(
G) Finding patterns in climate changes, which would otherwise not have been detected 
[@data-collection-for-climate-changes_2014]

Even though the described examples require a large corpus of data and utilization of Knowledge 
Discovery, some of them might not necessarily depend on Personal Data. For other scenarios, 
Personal Data are indispensable, and still other scenarios only implicitly rely on data collected from individuals. As 
noted in the [previous section on Big Data](personal-data-in-the-context-of-the-big-data-movement), 
it depends on the purpose, which can be defined i.a. through a existing *business model*. 
But at least in those examples it seems to be common motivation to primarily improve and enhance the 
collector's product in order to satisfy its customers - yet again that depends on what is considered 
as product and who are the customers, generally indicated by the money flow.

Generalizing businesses based on its affiliation to an industry sector is hardly an argument for 
utilizing Personal Data, but empirically a rough attribution often suffices in order to get a 
picture of possible business models. With that said, the following observation can be made.
When putting a Top 10 List of industries utilizing *Big Data* 
[@graphic_2015_applications-of-big-data-in-10-industry-verticals] and a visualization showing 
categories of personal data targeted by data collectors [@graphic_2012_personal-data-ecosystem] 
side by side, it appears to be that at least seven [^industries-as-data-collectors] of these 
industries can be identified as data collectors, whereas less then a half 
[^industries-as-data-brokers] are participating in being a [Data Broker](#terminologies--data-broker), 
but almost all of them are suspected to target people's personal data, whether obtained by 
themselves or acquired from *Data Brokers* (for more examples, see 
[@video_2016_corporate-surveillance-digital-tracking-big-data-privacy]).
Therefore, it's safe to say that *Personal Data* is considered either as the direct product, 
especially from a Data Broker's point of view, or an indirect product due to its essential part in *Big 
Data* approaches. The former generates direct revenue by selling these data and the latter might 
affect a business in a positive matter.

To conclude, the possession of more and precise information on individuals leads to increased 
revenue for the possessor. However, using personal data to improve a product does not necessarily become 
an issue unless the data owner is not the customer. Taking a closer look at the business model 
often reveals the role of personal data. Thus Personal Data becomes the currency and its owner 
becomes the product, while the possessor becomes controller and profiteer. This rather 
unsatisfying situation is going to be addressed further on. For example, by shifting the individual's 
role to offering its own data to those who have previously collected and sold them.
