Specification
==========================================



Based on all preceding discussions, a first draft of the *ReFlowd* Specification has been developed,
which can be found as an [attachment](#reflowd-working-draft) to this work. Not every conclusion has 
been applied, but various important aspects are already outlined so that first implementations can
start to be built upon them. The draft leaves room for followup work.  
It must be recognized, however, that in its current state it has no claim of completeness,
continuity or accuracy. Frequent changes are to be expected in the future.
