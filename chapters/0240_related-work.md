The idea of a digital vault, controlled and maintained by the data subject, is not new. It holds her 
most sensitive and valuable collections of bits and bytes, protected from all the data brokers, 
collectors and authorities, while interacting with the digital and physical world, opening and 
closing its door from time to time to either put something important to her inside or releases 
important information for someone else.  
In the mid and late 2000s the growth of computer performance and capacity crossed its zenith (see 
Moore's Law [@paper_1965_moors-law]). At the same time, the internet started to become a key part in 
many people's lives and in society as a whole. Facilitated by these circumstances, *Cloud Computing* 
has been on the rise ever since, causing the shift towards distributed processing and patterns 
alike, thereby making it possible to rethink solutions from the past and try to go new ways, namely 
a breakthrough 2007 in *Neuronal Networks* courtesy of G. Hinton 
[@podcast_2015_cre-neuronale-netze]. As a result, fields like *Data Mining*, *Machine Learning*, 
*Artificial Intelligence* and most recently combined under the collective term called *Big Data*, 
have gained a wide range of attention as tools for knowledge discovery. In almost any industry a 
greater amount of resources is invested in these areas 
[@web_2016_industries-intention-to-invest-in-big-data]. 

The initial motivation for this project can be understood as a counter-movement away from all the 
data silos in the cloud, returning to a focus on privacy, the individual, and her digital alter 
ego.

From simple middleware-solutions to full-fledged software-based platforms through to embedded
hardware devices, a great variety of approaches have started to appear in the mid 2000s, continuing 
to this day. However a side effect was, over time, various research teams and projects have invented 
and coined different terms, which, in the end, all refer to the same (or similar) concept. The 
following list shows some of them *(alphabetical order)*:

\newpage

+   Databox
+   Identity Manager
+   Personal ...
    -   Agent
    -   Container
    -   Data Store/Service/Stream (PDS)
    -   Data Vault
    -   Information Hub
    -   Information Management System (PIMS)
+   Vendor Relationship Management (VRM)

One of the first occurring research projects was *ProjectVRM*, which originated from *Berkman Center 
for Internet & Society* at *Harvard University*. As its name suggests, it was inspired by the idea 
of turning the concept of a *Customer Relationship Management (CRM)* upside down. This puts the 
vendor's customers back in charge of their data previously managed by vendors. It also solves the 
problem of unintended data redundancy - from the customers perspective. Over time the project has 
grown to the largest and most influential one in this research field. It has transformed into an 
umbrella and hub for all kinds of projects and research related to that topic 
[@web_2016_projectvrm_development-work], whether it's frameworks or standards, services offering 
(e.g. privacy protection), reference implementations, applications, software or hardware components. 
*VRM* became more and more a synonym for a set of principles, for example *"Customers must have 
control of data they generate and gather. [They] must be able to assert their own terms of 
engagement"* [@web_2016_projectvrm_principles, para. 3-4]. These principles can be found in various 
forms across much work done in this area of research.

Another work of research worth mentioning, because of the foundational work it has done, is the 
european funded project called *Trusted Architecture for Securely Shared Service* (TAS3)
[@web_2011_tas3-project]. This project has led to an open source reference implementation called 
*ZXID* [^more-infos_zxid]. The major goal was to develop an architecture, that generalizes various 
approaches towards a non context-agnostic solution fitting into more sophisticated and dynamic 
scenarios, while still respecting commercial businesses (vendors) and users (customers), but at the 
same time facilitating a high level of user-centric security and privacy i.a. by a developed policy 
framework. Due to these requirements the architecture ended up being rather complex 
[@graphic_2011_architecture_components-of-organization-domain]. The implementation, called *ZXID*, 
involves several standards, for example SAML 2.0 [^abbr_saml2] and XACML [^abbr_xacml], and has just 
three third-party dependencies, *OpenSSL*, *cURL (libcurl)* and *zlib*. As of now it even supports 
Java, PHP and Perl.  
The project has lasted for a period of 4 years. After completion in 2011, research has continued 
i.a. by the *Liberty Alliance Project*. It is now part of the *Kantara Initiative* 
[@web_kantara-initiative], including all documents and results. These results are occasionally 
referenced, i.a. by the IEEE [@paper_2013_the-personal-data-store-approach-to-personal-data-security_2013].

A research project, which is probably the closest to what this work aims to create, bears the name 
*openPDS* [@paper_2012_openpds_on-trusted-use-of-large-scale-personal-data] and is done by 
*Humans Dynamics Lab* [@web_mit_openpds-safeanswers-project-page], which again is part of 
*MIT Media Laboratories*. Despite the usual concepts of a *openPDS*, it introduces multi-platform
components and user interfaces including mobile devices, and also separates the persistence layer 
physically. This approach enables place- and time-independent administrative access for the data
subject. Moreover, with their idea of *SafeAnswers* 
[@paper_2014_openpds_protecting-privacy-of-meta-data-through-safeanswers], the team goes a step 
further. The concept behind that idea is based around *remote code execution*, briefly described in 
[one of the user stories in the first chapter](#header-applying-for-a-loan-and-checking-creditworthiness). 
It abstracts the concept of a data request to a more human-understandable level: a simple question.
This question consists of two representations: (A) a human-readable question of a third party, 
and (B) a code-based representation of that question, which gets executed in a sandbox on the data 
subjects's *openPDS* system with the required data as arguments. The data, used as arguments, is 
implicitly defined trough (A). The output of that execution represents both answer and response. 

Aside from all the research projects done within the academic context, applications with a 
commercial interest have also started to occur in a variety of sectors. Microsoft's *HealthVault*
[@web_microsoft_healthvault], for example, which aims to replace the patient's paper-based medical 
records and combine them in one digital version. This results in a patient-centered medical data and 
document archive, helping doctors, for example, to make more accurate decisions on medical
treatment.

*Meeco* [@web_meeco_how-it-works] [@slides_2015_meeco-case-study], based on the MyData-Project 
[@whitepaper_2014_mydata-a-nordic-model-for-human-centered-personal-data-management-and-processing], 
essentially just replaces platform-agnostic advertisement service providers with a closed 
environment and serves ads on its own. Although data subjects in this environment are provided with 
more control over what information they reveal, this approach doesn't take the eagerly demanded next 
step of getting rid of the advertisement market as a revenue stream and, instead, finding a suitable 
business model that focuses on the data subject, not surrounding them with just another walled 
garden.

A recently announced project, sponsored by Germany's *Federal Ministry of Education and Research*, 
but developed and maintained primarily by *Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft* in cooperation with several 
private companies like *PricewaterhouseCoopers AG*, *Volkswagen AG*, *thyssenkrupp AG* or 
*REWE Systems GmbH*, is the so called *Industrial Data Space* [@web_industrial-data-space]. 
The project unifies both, research and commercial interests and runs over a time period of three 
years until the third quarter of 2018. It aims *"[...] to facilitate the secure exchange and easy 
linkage of data in business ecosystems"*, where at the same time *"[...] ensuring digital 
sovereignty of data owners"* [@whitepaper_2016_industrial-data-space, p. 4]. Here, "data owners" 
seems not referring to *data subjects*, but to organisations who are in possession of the demanded 
data. So, it will be interesting to see how these two related but distinct objectives come together 
in the future. Based on the white paper, the project's focus mainly seems to lie in enabling and 
standardizing the way companies collect, exchange and aggregate data with each other across process 
chains to ensure high interoperability and accessibility.
